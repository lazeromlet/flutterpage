## Overview

  Flutter is a toolkit that allows you to create applications for Android and IOS from a single codebase in a different language entirely. Flutter runs with the dart language as its Coding language. This language was specifically designed for Flutter it has relatively simple syntax and is easy to pick up. In Flutter everything is essentially a widget and UI's are created with widget trees, widgets can be inside of other widgets and have text or anything else be inside of them as well. It allows for static and dynamic typing  when coding variables. One of the features heavily hyped up about the Platform is the ability to see changes made to an app while it is running with the "hot-reload" feature, potentially saving coders a decent amount of time when prototyping. It also allows for ahead of time (AOT) compiling to native machine code which makes for quick startup times for apps. It also has the ability to compiler into JavaScript so it can be used to create Web Apps out of the same source code that the mobile apps were developed with.
